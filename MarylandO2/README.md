## Overview

![Maryland Chesapeake Dissolved O2 levels vs Oyster Sanctuaries](./images/main-image.png)


ArcGIS mapping project showing areas within the Maryland Chesapeake where dissolved O2 levels were detected to be below 5mg/l.  This information is overlayed with current MD government data indicating the locations of Oyster sanctuaries.

Oyster restoration is a major focal area and strategy for "saving the bay" and returning the Chesapeake back to a natural state of balance.  The idea behind this map is to show **potential** areas where low levels of dissovled O2 may negatively impact oyster restoration efforts.
